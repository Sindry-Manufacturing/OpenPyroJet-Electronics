This directory contains KiCAD 5.1.x design files for a set of PCB's that make up the OpenPyroJet Gen 3.1 printhead. 
 
The directory could be better named as Printhead (as opposed to Nozzle), but I believe thats hard to do once a KiCAD project has been started?


Printhead PCB Versions:
-------------

Gen3.1b:
Production: JLCPCB, 2 Layer, 1.6mm, Green
Date:  2022-0330

* change the Nozzle PCB screw holes from M1.27 to 0.635mm
* label each PCB with a letter, ie: A, B, C & D.  This will make referencing them easier.


Gen3.1a:
Production: JLCPCB, 2 Layer, 1.6mm, Green
Date:  2022-03-29

* swapped the Connector PCB 1.27mm inlet holes for 6 x 1mm and 2 x 0.8mm holes.  This gives thicker filament pads (0.4mm wide).


Gen3.1:
Production: JLCPCB, 2 Layer, 1.6mm, Green
Date:  2022-03-27

* initial version, with one of PCB PCB produced
