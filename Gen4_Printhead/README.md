This is the latest edition of the pyrojet printhead, with straight pass through nozzles, and material feedin channels, as well as a greatly simplified assembly process.
The use of threaded inserts helps greatly with ease of assembly and disassembly, as well as circuit routing. 
The prior generation's M1 screws have been eliminated completely. 
the 16 pin IDC connector has been retained. 
the nozzles have all been made as 0.4 mm diameter through holes with no plating of any kind. The heaters on the connector plate have been made as 0.4mm wide contacts.

The tank has been narrowed to improve fuel circulation speed, and the inlet plate has has the solder pads for the inlet and outlet copper pipes expanded to facilitate easier soldering.
