This directory contains KiCAD 5.1.x design files for the OpenPyroJet Controller Board. 
 

Controller Board:
-----------------

V0.7:
Production: JLCPCB, 2 Layer, 1.6mm, Black
Date:  2022-06-14
 
Done: added OLED 128x128px M2 mounting hole to PCB
Done: changed R4 from 10uF to 100nF so Rotary Encoder would work CCW


V0.6:
Production: JLCPCB, 2 Layer, 1.6mm, Blue
Date:  2022-05-11

* would it be handy to include a set of 4 DIP switches for easy user/program config? (not enough spare GPIO for this)
Done: move the M3 OLED screen mounting hole a bit downwards 0.5mm
Done: move RGB LED to otherside of board to make it easier to be seen.
Done: rotate D3+R8 (buzzer) to RH or LH side of buzzer
Done: swap the 4 x 0402 resistors to 0603, to make it easier for people to assemble
Done: change UART: EN & IO0 labels to match ESP32: RESET & BOOT
Done: remove i2C being sent to Driver board and replace with SPI-4 pin
Done: swap out 20pin connector for a 24 pin connector to the Driver board
Done: break out all non-used GPIO to a Test Point (TP).
Done: add connector for printhead pump circulation via PWM on GPIO26 to external board
Done: fix Green LED text (extra L) on back of PCB
Done: add a white box for S/N area to back of PCB
Done: add User Switch GPIO text to back of PCB:  GPIO26


V0.5:
Production: JLCPCB, 4 Layer, 1.6mm, Green
Date:  2022-03-22

Initial version.
Done: use a ESP32-Wroom-32E 16MB Flash MCU
Done: Rotary Encoder for menu selection
Done: 128x64px i2C OLED screen
Done: add a 20 pin (2 x 10 pin header) connector to mate with Driver board
Done: Micro USB connector for programming via CP2102 UART
