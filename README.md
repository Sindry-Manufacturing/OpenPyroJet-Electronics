These sets of sub-folders contain KiCAD 5.1 based designs for experimenting with a PCB based metal/ceramic 3D Printer. 

Gen3.1_Printhead       ; initial experimental PCB based Printhead

Printhead-Controller   ; HW board that runs the Driver board

Printhead-Driver       ; HW circuitry to drive the printhead

software               ; basic Arduino based software to test the Controller & Driver boards.  See: https://github.com/Sindry-Manufacturing/OpenPyrojet-Jetpack  for a much more complete solution
